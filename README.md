# [Project 1: Is there a wage gap in Mexico? Overview:](https://github.com/luis-telesforo/DS_Project1)
* In this project we take two datasets from [INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/enoe/15ymas/datosabiertos/2022/conjunto_de_datos_enoen_2022_1t_csv.zip) to chek whether there is a wage gap in Mexico.
* From our analysis we cannot conclude anything about the wage gap in Mexico.
* A summary chart is provided

# [Project 2: Cleaning a dataset. Overview:](https://github.com/luis-telesforo/DS_Project2)
* We clean a csv using Pandas
* We apply several methods e.g. regex, string methods, date formatting

# [Project 3: A low cost alternative to cross validation](https://github.com/luis-telesforo/DS_Project3)
* If we want to find the best model out of 1000 different models using a 5-fold cross validation we need to train 5000 models. We present an alternative that uses hypothesis test that only requires to train 1000 models. Thus, we decrease computational costs by 80%.
